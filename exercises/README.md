# Exercise Folder

This folder contains various coding exercises and practice assignments created during my web development learning journey.

Each exercise is self-contained and demonstrates a specific concept such as:

- JavaScript basics
- DOM manipulation
- CSS layouts
- Event handling
- and more.

These are not full applications, but small prototypes to build skills.
