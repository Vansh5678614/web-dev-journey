# Video Playlist Project

## Overview

This project is a dynamic video playlist web page that displays video cards with thumbnails, titles, channel names, views, and upload timestamps. It demonstrates:

- Creating HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript
- Formatting large numbers (views) with K (thousands) and M (millions) suffixes
- Handling empty state UI where no videos are available
- Incrementally increasing container height as more cards are added
- Basic CSS styling with flexbox and positioning
- Planning for responsiveness and user interaction

## Features

- **Dynamic card creation**  
  Cards are created via a JavaScript function `createCard()` that takes parameters like thumbnail URL, video duration, title, channel, views, and age in months.

- **Views formatting**  
  The number of views is formatted to use "K" for thousands and "M" for millions for better readability.

- **Empty state handling**  
  When there are no videos, the container displays a message and has zero height. When cards are added, the height grows automatically.

- **Flexible styling**  
  CSS uses flexbox for layout, gap for spacing, and position properties for timestamp placement on thumbnails.

## Future Improvements / To-Dos

- Add media queries for responsiveness on different screen sizes.
- Create a user input form or prompt to dynamically add cards through UI interaction.
- Store timestamps properly (consider using `time` element or JS date functions).
- Enhance styling of cards and container for better UX.
- Use template strings or template literals for easier HTML insertion.
- Implement a button to add cards via JS event listeners.
- Support billion views (add "B" formatting).
- Consider persisting data using localStorage or backend.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Cards are generated by calling the `createCard()` function in `script.js`.
3. Modify or add calls to `createCard()` with your own data to populate the playlist.
4. See the container adjust height automatically as you add cards.
