# Flexbox-Based Navigation Bar

## Overview

This project showcases a **simple responsive navigation bar** built using HTML and CSS Flexbox.

The navigation bar contains five links:
- Products
- For business
- Resources
- Support
- Our Company

These links are styled horizontally and adjust using `flex-wrap`, making it more adaptable to screen sizes.

## Features

- **Flexbox Layout**: The navbar uses `display: flex` for easy horizontal alignment and spacing.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses `flex-wrap: wrap` and `gap` to ensure spacing and wrapping on smaller screens.
- **Minimal Styling**: Clean, modern design with basic styling for text and links.
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses `<nav>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` elements correctly for accessibility and SEO.
