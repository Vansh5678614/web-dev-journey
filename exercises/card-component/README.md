# Card Component - Tiger Cub

## Description

This mini project creates a styled card component using HTML and CSS. The card displays an image, labels, a title, a description, and a "Read More" button.

### Features:
- A **tiger cub image** positioned at the top-left of the card.
- A list of **labels** styled as inline badges.
- A **title** below the labels.
- A **description** paragraph providing more details.
- A **"Read More"** button styled and positioned within the card.

### Styling:
- The card uses `position: absolute` for precise placement of elements inside the container.
- The card has rounded corners, shadow, and a clean white background.
- The labels have a green color (`#89AC46`) with borders and shadows.
- The button has a matching color scheme with subtle shadows.

## Usage

- Open `index.html` in a browser to view the card.
- The CSS is linked externally via `style.css`.
- The image file `tiger_cub.png` is located in the `images/` folder and must be present for the image to display correctly.

## Notes

- This card design is **not responsive** yet. It uses fixed viewport-based width and height (`vw` and `vh` units) and absolute positioning.
- The card is centered horizontally using margins.
- For responsiveness, media queries or flexible layout techniques can be added in the future.
