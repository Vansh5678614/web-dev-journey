  `1.mp4`, `2.mp4`, `3.mp4`  
  *(Includes optional sources for WebM and Ogg formats and thumbnails.)*

## 🧩 Features

- Navigation bar to quickly jump to **Audio** or **Video** sections.
- Embedded HTML5 `<audio>` and `<video>` players.
- Proper use of semantic tags: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`.
- Copyright footer.
- User-friendly layout with section headings.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Make sure the media files (`.mp3`, `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.ogv`, `thumbnail1.jpg`, etc.) are placed in the **same directory** as the HTML file.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser.

## 📌 Note

- This project uses **only HTML**, with no CSS or JavaScript.
- Ideal for beginners to understand basic web page layout and multimedia embedding.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- Add CSS to enhance layout and responsiveness.
- Include JavaScript to add interactivity (e.g., play/pause buttons, playlists).
- Add media queries for mobile support.

## Note

The audio and video files referenced in the HTML (e.g., `1.mp3`, `1.mp4`) are **not included** in this repository.  
To test the media player, you will need to add your own media files with those names or update the source paths accordingly.
