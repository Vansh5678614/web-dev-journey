# Paragraph Styling with CSS

## Description

This mini project demonstrates how to style paragraphs inside a `<div>` using CSS pseudo-classes.

### Requirements:
- The **first paragraph** inside each `<div>` should have:
  - Background color: **yellow**
  - Text color: **red**

- All **other paragraphs** inside the same `<div>` should have:
  - Background color: **blue**
  - Text color: **white**

### Details:
- The HTML structure includes multiple `<div>` elements.
- Each `<div>` contains multiple `<p>` elements.
- The CSS uses the `:first-child` and `:not(:first-child)` selectors to apply different styles to paragraphs based on their position.

### How to use:
- Open the `index.html` file in a browser to see the styled paragraphs.
- No JavaScript or external libraries are needed.

## Notes
- The provided HTML should **not be changed** as per the project instructions.
- All styling is done internally within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section.
